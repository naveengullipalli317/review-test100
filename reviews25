Havent repaired anything or replaced anything but tires and normal maintenance items. Upgraded tires to Michelin LX series helped fuel economy. Would buy another in a second",4.625
1, on 07/17/05 21:59 PM (PDT),Mark ,2002 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 3500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Disappointmnet," Bought this car as a commuter vehicle for a van pool.  I was very disappointed in the vehicle in comparison to a 1997 model I had previously.  The motor was sluggish and tended to have a rough idle.  The A/C was better than the old van, but still lacked a separate control for the front and back.  What I was most disappointed with was that in moving up five years, I lost driver room, the ability to adjust the steering wheel to where I like it, and the passenger seats, by all accounts were less comfortable.  What I noticed in driving is that the vehicle had a very large turning radius.  Very difficult to maneuver in traffic.",2.125

4, on 02/09/05 18:52 PM (PST),VanMan ,2001 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Not what Dodge used to be," Good solid frame and suspension.  Well equipped, full power.  Gauges and controls are well designed and located.  Nice to drive once you are up and in.  No leg room on passenger side.  318 engine seems very weak and some spark plugs are very hard to access.  Terrible gas mileage (avg 12MPG).  Sheet metal is flimsy and dents if you lean against it or bump it.  Paint chips and scratches very easily.  Sliding side door jumped the track and scraped the whole side of the van.  Rear door caught in wind and pulled bolts out of frame.  Three front windshields in three years (stress point in center?).  No mechanical problems with drive train.  Reliable.  Still not the quality my older Dodge vans had.",2.875

6, on 08/01/17 16:40 PM (PDT),Guy ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 2500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Failur is lurking in every corner," Purchased the vehicle in 2003 second hand with 15000 miles from the owner (a one driver operator, not rental). This review was written in 2017 with only 110000 miles on it! It has been a great service van for my business but not without flaws. After warranty expired problems begin. Had to replace computer controller few times. Fuel hose went bad, chair adjustment lever broke, minor repairs here and there, water pump replaced, temperature control unit replaced, gas tank and pump replaced. Using a very accurate repair expenses controlled by business analysis I can say that the average repair cost is around $600 per year. This vehicle can't go farther than 10 trips without me worrying when would be the next problem. Dealer sticker say 12/15 miles per gallon but with very conservative driving my records show 17 miles per gallon. Overall I don't think it's the best value for vehicle but being optimistic as I am it is not the worst either. Hope this helps.",3
7, on 02/25/06 06:09 AM (PST),smithtp ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Ext Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Great Van," Bought used with 34k,the conversion package by Elk automotive is top rate. Has leather, cd, dvd, rear air, tv, rear stereo, all the goodies. Very easy to drive despite its size, ride is nice and quiet inside. With the 318 engines and regular service these things are allmost bullet-proof. As most manufacturers produce very few of the large van conversions any more and the new ones costing 50k that are available, I feel that for 20k I stole this thing. One of the best things is it's still under warranty with Chryslers 7/70 plan. These are the only way to travel, if you are buying for everyday use, it's probably not the right vehicle. ",4.625

Van is very comfortable for travel. The built in antennae for the tv is awsome for watching local chanels. Van is very quiet and rides smooth. Regency does a great job on their conversion packages.Awsome family vehicle",3.25
9, on 03/03/04 00:00 AM (PST),Dodgem ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Ext Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),She's a looker!," I bought the van new with a conversion package, Raised roof, TV, VCR etc.. 2003 leftover good deals still available with zero financing. I have a 5.2 Ltr V-8, plenty of power, nice tight smooth ride. A little short on leg room but overall very comfortable. Lots of windows, everyone gets a window seat. It looks great, I've been getting loads of compliments.You won't be sorry.  ",4

12, on 01/22/12 10:44 AM (PST),nbrandl ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),The beauty can mask anything,"  I am a mechanic, I bought my 2006 Dodge Magnum 3.5 High Output AWD a year ago with 54,600 miles on it. As always, I performed a full vehicle check on the car before purchasing it. I loved this car, it was fast fun, elegant, and provided everything I needed, at first. Since I bought it I have had numerous mechanical, programing, and electrical issues currently totaling to $4,500 dollars. Just to give an idea, at 70,000 miles my throttle just went out (this isn't included in what I have already spent) and I now have to replace the entire intake system which is going to cost around $2,200 (these costs don't include mechanics fees, which will potentially double the costs) *A battery cost $300 ",3.625

14, on 03/19/11 16:10 PM (PDT),fds1961 ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),New Owner," I drove a Dodge Charger last year and like the ride, so when it was time for a new car I went for the Magnum. I like to be able to load stuff the flea market and go fishing so I went with the wagon. It was like driving a SUV, and the speed!!! I had to check myself a few times, but this is the most powerful car I ever had. I drove a Nissan Altima for 2 years and this is a whole new class of car. Stylish, fast, a real head turner. It had over 80,000 miles, but you can't tell by the way it rides and excels on the road. So far so good, it seem to be a well build wagon with AWD for the snow, glad that I got this.... ",5
15, on 10/27/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Chris ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Money Pit," I had many problems with my Magnum RT. Wheels started to corrode, transmission leaked, windshield wiper controls had to be replaced (all fixed under warranty). Had to replace factory tires at 31,000 miles, replaced a tie-rod at about 40,000 miles, and the brake rotors warped. Wiper controls were again acting up, and a noise started in the front suspension when I finally decided to trade it off. Loved the power and looks, but it had to go. Build and component quality was awful. This car turned me off of Dodge products.",3.75
16, on 09/22/10 00:00 AM (PDT),alambra ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),06 R/T AWD," What an unbelievable machine. I have never driven anything like it. Perfectly engineered, meticulously designed. Simply perfect. It's time for Toyota to stop relentlessly pursuing perfection. Because Dodge got there first with the magnum rt. The power is unbelievable. Handling outstanding. And comfort is second to none. I've been a mustang owner and lover for the past 15 years. But now, after driving this magnum hemi for less than a week, I'm in love with it. With 82k miles it feels as if it just rolled off the assembly line and into my garage. Simply amazing automobile.

17, on 08/23/10 14:26 PM (PDT),Joel ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Proud of my Magnum," Man, this thing is huge - at 4500 lbs it weighs as much my wife's mininvan! And, it drives like it, too - not exactly ""agile."" I would have never payed $35,000 for a new one, but for $13,000 w/65,000 miles I think it was a steal, and it's one of the coolest looking cars ever. Doesn't feel as fast as you might think it would, and gas mileage still not good even w/cylinder management. But, every time I look at it or smash the gas, it makes me smile. Oh, and it'll hold quite a bit of crap, too.",4.375
18, on 07/17/10 07:47 AM (PDT),Jnet_2006 ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),2006 Dodge Magnum SE," I am very happy with my magnum. I was looking a car with a lot of room. My magnum is a car with the space of a SUV. It has the small V6 so the gas mileage is not all that bad. I would of never got a SUV with 51,000 miles for the great price I paid for my car. My 2006 Magnum is like new. ",4.875
19, on 04/29/10 07:49 AM (PDT),knowles ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),2006 SE 2.7," Love the style. Mine has color matched 22"" chrome wheels...had a side wall puncture. Can't replace just one tire and had to go to several places to find a good tire in stock since I did not want to wait to order tires. Cost for 2 was pricey but that has nothing to do with the car. Also, to anyone thinking about beefing up the look with big tires and rims, okay for around town but you lose some of the quality in the ride. Have tried to figure out why but no one can give me an answer. Non the less, with the color coordinated rims (car is metallic red) it's an eye catcher. No mechanical problems. It's a 2006 SE 2.7 with 40,000. I wasn't looking to win a race and don't want a gas hog.",4.75
20, on 07/01/09 07:58 AM (PDT),ACM ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Satisfied in PA with black R/T AWD," Traved to Michigan from PA to by this car used with 28,000 on it.Downsized from a 01 AWD Towne and Country Limited.This car is fast without a doubt and functional to boot. I have hauled my 20' extension ladder and  wheelbarrow in the back with the seats folded down. More than enough room for the dog. Had to replace both outer tie rods(under warranty) and o2 sensor (warranty ran out) but still happy with the vehicle. Will add roof rack.Great in the snow with snow tires as I have owned 4 wheel drive and AWD before.Got to have it here in this area. Have to wait and see how it holds up but so far so good.",4.375
21, on 06/21/09 19:53 PM (PDT),Greg L. ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Fun & quality," This is a very large car that handles like a sports car.  Corners flat, breaks straight, very comfortable ride and considering the too small engine, it has good acceleration.  It does NOT like to pull a trailer, but if you're reasonable it's okay with that too. The drivers seat is far too narrow, I'm a big guy and have to find just the right spot to get comfortable.  Some people don't like the sparten interior, but I like the design.  However, a little less of a plastic look would be nice.   The exterior design is outstanding and there are lots of storage pockets and nooks and crannies.  The standard tires are just adequate, but in Canada you really do need snow tires for winter safety.",4.5
22, on 06/07/09 02:01 AM (PDT),Dad'd Wagon - 33k m ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Magnum RT/AWD after 33500 Miles ," Had my Maggie now for 28 months and 33,500 miles.  Used Royal Purple since beginning.  CAR has been the most reliable , fun , trouble free car I have ever had.  Still sounds, feels, drives as I took it home.  No issues what so ever. Very pleased that we own a car that was discontinued also.... So what.. The AWD system I have never felt safer behind the wheel of any 4x4.  She is a tank and built well.. Keeping her forever...

23, on 01/07/09 12:55 PM (PST),baycity ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Awesome," I traded in my 3rd Yukon Denali 3 years ago for this car and I love it. I didn't need a big SUV, but I still needed the use of a utility vehicle for my business, kids and dogs. This car is great.  I average 20mpg with the 5.7 Hemi.  I can have my cake and eat it too.  I leased the car back in 2006 and just thought I would lease or buy another car when my time was up, but Chrysler sent me an offer I couldn't refuse. If I buy the car at the end of the lease, Chrysler will take a substantial amount off the residual buyout amount in the contract, so Iv'e decided to buy the car. 3 years and 57K miles later I haven't had any problems except with the navi which is a minor repair hopefully.",4.875
24, on 01/03/09 19:17 PM (PST),firetech ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),One of the best cars I've ever had," I needed to replace my aging and worn out Volvo 850 wagon. We are a family of 5 including two teenagers, one who is 6 feet tall. I needed a roomy car, that actually had legroom in the rear seat for my son. Short of buying a limo the Dodge LX cars are one of the only ones that fit the bill. I also wanted power and safety in the way of front and side air bags, trac control etc, etc. This car has it all in spades. I set out to but the 6cyl SXT but couldn't pass up the R/T when it crossed my tracks. If you are sensible on the throttle the R/T's fuel mileage is almost as good as the 3.5 SXT. My advice is if you have a choice, buy the R/T with the 5.7, it's way more fun and still decent on fuel.",4.75
25, on 09/05/08 19:43 PM (PDT),MikeInMass ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),What to expect at 80000 miles," I bought my '06 SXT RWD used in Nov. '06 with 13k miles.  It now has nearly 81k miles.  Overall, it's been very reliable...roomy, comfortable, fast, no rattles, and decent gas mileage (22 mpg avg. in mixed highway and city gridlock). The RWD has only been a problem once, in a very heavy snow. The front brake rotors were replaced at 38k, and will need to be replaced again soon.  The original tires lasted to 71k. At approx. 75k, a rocker arm broke, a $500 fix.  The mechanic says it's common, but not frequent, on the 3.5 liter motor.  Other than that, just oil changes and tire rotation.  I love the styling of the car, too bad it's been discontinued.  Everyone who rides in it loves it!",4.625
