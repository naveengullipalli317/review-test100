Havent repaired anything or replaced anything but tires and normal maintenance items. Upgraded tires to Michelin LX series helped fuel economy. Would buy another in a second",4.625
1, on 07/17/05 21:59 PM (PDT),Mark ,2002 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 3500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Disappointmnet," Bought this car as a commuter vehicle for a van pool.  I was very disappointed in the vehicle in comparison to a 1997 model I had previously.  The motor was sluggish and tended to have a rough idle.  The A/C was better than the old van, but still lacked a separate control for the front and back.  What I was most disappointed with was that in moving up five years, I lost driver room, the ability to adjust the steering wheel to where I like it, and the passenger seats, by all accounts were less comfortable.  What I noticed in driving is that the vehicle had a very large turning radius.  Very difficult to maneuver in traffic.",2.125

4, on 02/09/05 18:52 PM (PST),VanMan ,2001 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Not what Dodge used to be," Good solid frame and suspension.  Well equipped, full power.  Gauges and controls are well designed and located.  Nice to drive once you are up and in.  No leg room on passenger side.  318 engine seems very weak and some spark plugs are very hard to access.  Terrible gas mileage (avg 12MPG).  Sheet metal is flimsy and dents if you lean against it or bump it.  Paint chips and scratches very easily.  Sliding side door jumped the track and scraped the whole side of the van.  Rear door caught in wind and pulled bolts out of frame.  Three front windshields in three years (stress point in center?).  No mechanical problems with drive train.  Reliable.  Still not the quality my older Dodge vans had.",2.875

6, on 08/01/17 16:40 PM (PDT),Guy ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 2500 3dr Ext Van (5.2L 8cyl 4A),Failur is lurking in every corner," Purchased the vehicle in 2003 second hand with 15000 miles from the owner (a one driver operator, not rental). This review was written in 2017 with only 110000 miles on it! It has been a great service van for my business but not without flaws. After warranty expired problems begin. Had to replace computer controller few times. Fuel hose went bad, chair adjustment lever broke, minor repairs here and there, water pump replaced, temperature control unit replaced, gas tank and pump replaced. Using a very accurate repair expenses controlled by business analysis I can say that the average repair cost is around $600 per year. This vehicle can't go farther than 10 trips without me worrying when would be the next problem. Dealer sticker say 12/15 miles per gallon but with very conservative driving my records show 17 miles per gallon. Overall I don't think it's the best value for vehicle but being optimistic as I am it is not the worst either. Hope this helps.",3
7, on 02/25/06 06:09 AM (PST),smithtp ,2003 Dodge Ram Cargo Van 1500 3dr Ext Van (3.9L 6cyl 3A),Great Van," Bought used with 34k,the conversion package by Elk automotive is top rate. Has leather, cd, dvd, rear air, tv, rear stereo, all the goodies. Very easy to drive despite its size, ride is nice and quiet inside. With the 318 engines and regular service these things are allmost bullet-proof. As most manufacturers produce very few of the large van conversions any more and the new ones costing 50k that are available, I feel that for 20k I stole this thing. One of the best things is it's still under warranty with Chryslers 7/70 plan. These are the only way to travel, if you are buying for everyday use, it's probably not the right vehicle. ",4.625

12, on 01/22/12 10:44 AM (PST),nbrandl ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SXT 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),The beauty can mask anything,"  I am a mechanic, I bought my 2006 Dodge Magnum 3.5 High Output AWD a year ago with 54,600 miles on it. As always, I performed a full vehicle check on the car before purchasing it. I loved this car, it was fast fun, elegant, and provided everything I needed, at first. Since I bought it I have had numerous mechanical, programing, and electrical issues currently totaling to $4,500 dollars. Just to give an idea, at 70,000 miles my throttle just went out (this isn't included in what I have already spent) and I now have to replace the entire intake system which is going to cost around $2,200 (these costs don't include mechanics fees, which will potentially double the costs) *A battery cost $300 ",3.625

I like to be able to load stuff the flea market and go fishing so I went with the wagon. It was like driving a SUV, and the speed!!! I had to check myself a few times, but this is the most powerful car I ever had. I drove a Nissan Altima for 2 years and this is a whole new class of car. Stylish, fast, a real head turner. It had over 80,000 miles, but you can't tell by the way it rides and excels on the road. So far so good, it seem to be a well build wagon with AWD for the snow, glad that I got this.... ",5
15, on 10/27/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Chris ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Money Pit," I had many problems with my Magnum RT. Wheels started to corrode, transmission leaked, windshield wiper controls had to be replaced (all fixed under warranty). Had to replace factory tires at 31,000 miles, replaced a tie-rod at about 40,000 miles, and the brake rotors warped. Wiper controls were again acting up, and a noise started in the front suspension when I finally decided to trade it off. Loved the power and looks, but it had to go. Build and component quality was awful. This car turned me off of Dodge products.",3.75
16, on 09/22/10 00:00 AM (PDT),alambra ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),06 R/T AWD," What an unbelievable machine. I have never driven anything like it. Perfectly engineered, meticulously designed. Simply perfect. It's time for Toyota to stop relentlessly pursuing perfection. Because Dodge got there first with the magnum rt. The power is unbelievable. Handling outstanding. And comfort is second to none. I've been a mustang owner and lover for the past 15 years. But now, after driving this magnum hemi for less than a week, I'm in love with it. With 82k miles it feels as if it just rolled off the assembly line and into my garage. Simply amazing automobile.

17, on 08/23/10 14:26 PM (PDT),Joel ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Proud of my Magnum," Man, this thing is huge - at 4500 lbs it weighs as much my wife's mininvan! And, it drives like it, too - not exactly ""agile."" I would have never payed $35,000 for a new one, but for $13,000 w/65,000 miles I think it was a steal, and it's one of the coolest looking cars ever. Doesn't feel as fast as you might think it would, and gas mileage still not good even w/cylinder management. But, every time I look at it or smash the gas, it makes me smile. Oh, and it'll hold quite a bit of crap, too.",4.375

My magnum is a car with the space of a SUV. It has the small V6 so the gas mileage is not all that bad. I would of never got a SUV with 51,000 miles for the great price I paid for my car. My 2006 Magnum is like new. ",4.875
19, on 04/29/10 07:49 AM (PDT),knowles ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),2006 SE 2.7," Love the style. Mine has color matched 22"" chrome wheels...had a side wall puncture. Can't replace just one tire and had to go to several places to find a good tire in stock since I did not want to wait to order tires. Cost for 2 was pricey but that has nothing to do with the car. Also, to anyone thinking about beefing up the look with big tires and rims, okay for around town but you lose some of the quality in the ride. Have tried to figure out why but no one can give me an answer. Non the less, with the color coordinated rims (car is metallic red) it's an eye catcher. No mechanical problems. It's a 2006 SE 2.7 with 40,000. I wasn't looking to win a race and don't want a gas hog.",4.75

I have hauled my 20' extension ladder and  wheelbarrow in the back with the seats folded down. More than enough room for the dog. Had to replace both outer tie rods(under warranty) and o2 sensor (warranty ran out) but still happy with the vehicle. Will add roof rack.Great in the snow with snow tires as I have owned 4 wheel drive and AWD before.Got to have it here in this area. Have to wait and see how it holds up but so far so good.",4.375
21, on 06/21/09 19:53 PM (PDT),Greg L. ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Fun & quality," This is a very large car that handles like a sports car.  Corners flat, breaks straight, very comfortable ride and considering the too small engine, it has good acceleration.  It does NOT like to pull a trailer, but if you're reasonable it's okay with that too. The drivers seat is far too narrow, I'm a big guy and have to find just the right spot to get comfortable.  Some people don't like the sparten interior, but I like the design.  However, a little less of a plastic look would be nice.   The exterior design is outstanding and there are lots of storage pockets and nooks and crannies.  The standard tires are just adequate, but in Canada you really do need snow tires for winter safety.",4.5

23, on 01/07/09 12:55 PM (PST),baycity ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Awesome," I traded in my 3rd Yukon Denali 3 years ago for this car and I love it. I didn't need a big SUV, but I still needed the use of a utility vehicle for my business, kids and dogs. This car is great.  I average 20mpg with the 5.7 Hemi.  I can have my cake and eat it too.  I leased the car back in 2006 and just thought I would lease or buy another car when my time was up, but Chrysler sent me an offer I couldn't refuse. If I buy the car at the end of the lease, Chrysler will take a substantial amount off the residual buyout amount in the contract, so Iv'e decided to buy the car. 3 years and 57K miles later I haven't had any problems except with the navi which is a minor repair hopefully.",4.875
24, on 01/03/09 19:17 PM (PST),firetech ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),One of the best cars I've ever had," I needed to replace my aging and worn out Volvo 850 wagon. We are a family of 5 including two teenagers, one who is 6 feet tall. I needed a roomy car, that actually had legroom in the rear seat for my son. Short of buying a limo the Dodge LX cars are one of the only ones that fit the bill. I also wanted power and safety in the way of front and side air bags, trac control etc, etc. This car has it all in spades. I set out to but the 6cyl SXT but couldn't pass up the R/T when it crossed my tracks. If you are sensible on the throttle the R/T's fuel mileage is almost as good as the 3.5 SXT. My advice is if you have a choice, buy the R/T with the 5.7, it's way more fun and still decent on fuel.",4.75

It now has nearly 81k miles.  Overall, it's been very reliable...roomy, comfortable, fast, no rattles, and decent gas mileage (22 mpg avg. in mixed highway and city gridlock). The RWD has only been a problem once, in a very heavy snow. The front brake rotors were replaced at 38k, and will need to be replaced again soon.  The original tires lasted to 71k. At approx. 75k, a rocker arm broke, a $500 fix.  The mechanic says it's common, but not frequent, on the 3.5 liter motor.  Other than that, just oil changes and tire rotation.  I love the styling of the car, too bad it's been discontinued.  Everyone who rides in it loves it!",4.625
26, on 08/15/08 09:20 AM (PDT),R. Guimond ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Value Magnum, We bought the base Magnum back in July 05 when my wife totaled her PT Cruiser. This car is a great driving car and we get 24MPG overall with the 2.7 liter engine.  Mileage is very comparable to the many small SUVs we were looking at before we decided to buy our Magnum.  The 2.7L engine is lively and responsive and we've experienced no problems mechanically.,4.125

One test drive, and  found myself searching the globe for the Magnum I wanted. My wife begged me not to get rid of the Avalanche, but after a week of driving the Magnum, she hasn't looked back.",4.875

I've owned many sporty cars but never one that I could load a full family and all luggage in with ease! The Magnum also has the looks to turn heads.,4.875
31, on 04/06/08 09:04 AM (PDT),Greg ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon SE 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Stylish and flexible with lots of room," The SE is fun to drive, has wonderful racy styling and handles like a dream.  It corners flat and holds the road beautifully.  The 2.7 Liter engine is a little underpowered for the size of the vehicle, but considering it is such a small engine, I have no problem with available power.  I purchased the 2.7 specifically because I wanted a vehicle that affords good fuel economy, and it delivers that plus I like driving the Magnum.  I purchased the car in 2008 and am very happy with the value received.  I get a car that looks and feels like a new car and the 2 years depreciation (60% off new price) give me a real bargain.  I don't understand it but like getting such a great bargain!",4.625
32, on 04/05/08 23:06 PM (PDT),ACM ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Fun and flexible.," I went from a 2006 Honda Odyssey (3 steering racks in 20,000 miles was 3 too many) to the RT. The cargo volume is not quite that of the van but it is good. Four guys and golf bags are handled with ease. The gas mileage to date (5500 miles) is one mile to the gallon worse than the Honda. The fun to drive factor is approximately 8.5 out of 10. If you have to drive a wagon this is the one that will make you smile. I can only imagine how much fun the SRT8 must be to drive. I am already planning some tweaks to the engine and suspension because the chassis is just so good that it begs for more power and better spring rates. This really is a great platform, hats off to the engineers at Dodge",4.125

Even though I did not get the AWD, it still rocks in any weather, with the addition of Blizzaks for the winter. I'm 6'4"" and it is really comfortable, plus with two car seats in the back, the kids have enough room too. I put the whole family in and we go looking fo twisty turny roads to play on.  With the autostick, I can run that car pretty hard and it just keeps asking for more.  Cruises really nicely for the 25 mile each way commute, but gotta keep an eye on it. I tend to enjoy driving and sometimes look down and see 80 when I'm just having fun.  Definitely a family car for dad to have fun in!",4.625
34, on 03/13/08 20:04 PM (PDT),Tom's NYC Review ,2006 Dodge Magnum Wagon RT 4dr Wagon (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Should have bought it sooner," I purchased this car used with only 80 miles on it and got a super deal, number 1. I was statisfied with the price, leather , styling, sunroof, and the space. Hope it would be as powerful as my 1970 Cutlass which I missed dearly, and holy cow it was. Not only was it peppy and powerful but I had all the safety and comfort of a car built today. And yes, it does get good gas mileage when driven nicely, which I personally cannot do!

My daughter said it looked like a hearse. It could have been an instant muscle car but the 3.5 L V6 just didn't have it.I mean the 3.5 is a great motor just not the Horse power I wanted. So I bought a 2006 SRT8 w/ the 6.1 L Hemi. Wow! It's balck just like the one before and a whole lot faster. The power is almost unbelivable between the two. I miss the all leather seats and moon roof the SXT had. The 20"" rims make for a little more bumpy ride but the handling is superior.

Was I pleasantly surprised!  I love this car; it is so comfortable, so easy to handle, and comes in handy on Fridays when I take friends to lunch.  The ability to manuever the car is superior, I can back up easily into a parking space and it's great for hauling everything from the dogs to bags of mulch to groceries.  ",4.875

It is very useful as you can carry other people or use it to go to the hardware store. It is fast and fun to drive on top of that. It handles very good and rides really nice on the highway.  I had the RT before my SRT8 and both of these cars are real nice. It reminds me of my younger days in the 60's when a lot of people had ""sleeper wagons."" It runs with most cars on the street and yet gets great gas mileage.  425 HP and I am averaging between 19 and 21 MPG.  Depends on how many times you put your foot into it. How can you beat that?

I have had it now for a 1 1/2 years and am very pleased. I have 4 kids and can fit them all in and still have space in the back. The car drives very well and has great brakes although I would recommend ABS. I got the 2.7L v6 for the gas mileage. It does not have alot of power but I do get 20 mpg in the city.

Simply loved it but eventually sold it to a friend's son who kept bugging me for it (for 3 years).  After that I owned 2 Chargers, 1 R/T, 1 SRT and a Chrysler 300C.  I really missed  the wagon because of the versatility and nasty looks so when I was able to find the second wagon I grabbed it. Never have had any issues with any of these vehicles but then I take care of all the maintenance/repair myself so no one can mess them up. There is a HUGE difference between the 5.7 and 6.1 Hemi LX cars pretty much in all respects so for me it will always be the SRT. The 6.1 responds very well to small changes (tuning,exhaust,CAI) and kicks real butt when you also loose 150-200 lbs of weight from the car which is not that hard to do. Even with the 12 sec. 1/4 mile performance I get around 23mpg on 75mph trips. Best of both worlds and the darn thing is a wagon to boot! Kudo's to the SRT team.  This gang has brought back the old day attitude and swagger we had in the 60's and early 70's.

91, on 08/10/06 13:13 PM (PDT),Step Tyner ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),I love my Magnum," Aside from rather poor rear quarter visibility, that impossible-not-to- damage-while-parking lower front clip, and a seeming inability to ""memorize"" my garage door opener code, the car has been entirely trouble free.  The concept is a superb one. Who says station wagons have to be snails?  The interior cargo space includes handy grocery racks and a host of fascinating little compartments and such.  And, while the interior decor is a bit Spartan, the seats are comfortable and all the controls are conveniently placed.",4.375
92, on 05/31/06 04:19 AM (PDT),Charlie ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),SRT-8 Magnum," Not only is the 2006 Magnum a beautiful design it also has the awesome power that Dodge used to have back in the late 60's early 70's. You have the modern luxuaries of a Mercedez Benz and the ""holy cow"" power of a 1970 Hemi Roadrunner. My SRT Magnum came with GPS, Sirius Satelite Radio, all leather interior, (Gray on Black-Standard for SRT8) steering wheel remotes, sunroof and digital gauges with white face gauges. The new Hemi 6.1 liter is just as appealing to look at as the rest of the car. I do feel that the exhuast could have been a bit throatier, however you do hear the engine well at 6000 rpms. The ride and handling is smooth and confortable. All this for $40,000. I did well.",4.75
93, on 05/24/06 20:19 PM (PDT),Rx:MagnumQd ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),What an engine," Wow! This is one incredibly fast car. It replaced my Magnum RT, already a fast car. This one simply flies. The whole car has been upgraded from the suspension to the transmission to the brakes. It feels like a complete package. Handles suprisingly well for a 4300lb car. Seats are terrific, way better that the stock RT seats.  Driving the car is an exercise in right foot restraint. The barritone soundtrack that comes with a quick jab of the throttle is worth the price of admission alone. The thrust that comes with this right foot exercise is very impressive indeed. Remember, this car has more horsepower than any Corvette (except Z06) produced in the last 25 years. Overall, a blast to drive!",4.75
94, on 05/03/06 18:03 PM (PDT),Rocket Wagon ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),6.1 HEMI, The up  grade from my '05 R/T has been very exciting. The acceleration and roar from the HEMI makes it hard to drive it slow. My gas mileage has been the same as my R/T. ,5
95, on 03/27/06 06:28 AM (PST),hemimagnum ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),WOW American Muscle Returns," This car is unbelievable. It has room for the family and to haul different odds and ends. Even with 425 horses I have been getting 17-18mpg around and about town along with an occasaional jaunt on the thruway. But don't let me kid you, if you don't keep your foot out of it, which can be hard with the sensation you get when the motor starts to open up, the mileage will drop in a hurry. This car is almost too nice to drive on a daily basis. But what the heck, enjoy it. You only live once.",4.875
96, on 03/17/06 15:50 PM (PST),hemi58 ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),Wow," This car is unbelievable. Great performance and mpg isn't all that bad 18.5 average. I only got 23 on my Accord and I haven't had to take it into the dealer for any of the usual ""new car"" problems-this is my 2nd Magnum-1st was and R/T-plus I don't know what all the hubbub is about w/ the Asian cars I had two and they both left me stranded and unsure if they would start. Thanks but Ill stick w/ the GM Ford & Chrysler that always seem to get knocked for fit and finish. Everyone Ive had I put minimum of 150,000 miles and w/ no trouble other than the usual wear items-LOF battery brakes.",4.875
97, on 01/28/06 06:57 AM (PST),rick ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),Not your average wagon," Dodge didn't waste any money on bling bling here. Everything you need is covered, but the magic is underneath. The motor is a split personality crazy man. quiet and smooth when you need it to be. Step on the pedal and you are in another dimension. Amazing torque and acceleration(especially for a heavy car). Handles tight and the SRT8 seats are perfection. If you crave attention buy another car- although this car gets a knowing glance from anyone who understands Dodge's secret society. Generally you get the glance as you blast past them on straight AND twisty roads. Outward vision isn't great but you gain confidence in your mirrors after awhile. Build quality so far is excellent. Rock on ",4.875

Dodge can not figure out why it won't start, they'll get it running then suddenly it wont start again. Handled and performs great when it runs. Being returned under the lemon law and no, I will not get another.",3.375
99, on 12/03/05 20:54 PM (PST),hemi4fun ,2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8 SRT-8 4dr Wagon (6.1L 8cyl 5A),Hemi 4 real," We love this car. We had a magnum Rt and when this car came out with the 6.1 we had to go get it. If you're worried about gas then maybe you should buy a Honda, but the braking and performance of this car is outragous. Much better than the rt. Nothing on the street can touch you. The power is unbelievable, you will be impressed. I hope this will help you and make sure you haggle to get that mark up down. They will do it. We got the car for 41 and people were out there paying 60, so make sure you are ready to walk. They wont let you leave.",4.875

I have both cars and this one handles as good as the Charger.  The Mercedez, BMW, the 'stang, Nissan, or any other car on the road cannot match this car or the Charger for performance, style, speed, or quality...  I've tested all of the above and more and these two cars are the Kings of the road...  I blew a vette and 2 'stangs off the road and as far as the Mercedez goes, no challenge...  ",5
